    	<h1>Summary of the story:</h1>

    	<p>There is a ghost sitting watching TV, but he is very discouraged and alone. He gets thirsty but realizes that he does not have a glass of water, and gets up to look for it. However, he sees a mysterious shadow that scares and disturbs him, making him back away by hitting a small table. A photo falls, due to the blow, towards the ghost which was a photo of his family, the ghost, upon realizing the photo, remembers the death of his parents, but also the good times he had with them. With this, the ghost gained courage to face the shadow by turning on the lights in the hallway, discovering that it was just his coat. In the end, the ghost returned to his chair with his glass of water looking at the photo of his parents with affection, and continues watching TV with his happiness recovered.</p>
